    "- The class is broken into two sessions each covering one half-day block.\n",

    "    - Each module should cover around 90 minutes including a 10 minute break near the top of each hour.\n",
    "    - Within each module, multiple topics will be covered.\n",
    "- While the specific timings of each module may differ, overall we will plan to follow this format:\n",
    "    - Motivation for the topic covered will first be given.\n",
    "    - We'll examine how this is done in Python using the datarobot Python package and other packages like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc. You'll write the code as it is presented to help you start to become fluent in the syntax.\n",
    "    - Then you'll practice what you've just learned on a different problem/context by programming yourself.\n",
    "        - You can decide whether you'd like to try the beginner, intermediate, or advanced option.\n",
    "        - Ideally, you try all three!\n",
    "    - We'll go over ways to solve the particular problem and discuss solutions.\n",
    "    - We'll then head into covering the next topic in the module.\n",
    "- Overall, we want you to be able to practice your learning immediately to check for understanding and get help from us as needed to get things working."

    "You'll see that we have some overall themes in this class. First, we'll go over how to connect Python to the DataRobot client. Then we'll see how to make a DataRobot project. Inside that project, we'll look into featurelists and blueprints before diving into building models and evaluating and understanding them with the use of some visualizations. These main ideas are also covered in the DataRobot Python cheatsheet that has been included in the course ZIP file. We don't go over everything on that sheet in this class but it can be a useful resource. Now that we've talked about the general concepts of the course I'd like to cover the main expectations."
